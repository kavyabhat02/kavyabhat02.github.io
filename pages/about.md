Hi! I'm Kavya, an upcoming Masters student in Information Networking at Carnegie Mellon University.

I just finished my B.Tech in CSE at NITK Surathkal. Loved that place. <br>

Curious about tech, photography, music and books.<br>

Avid reader, amateur photographer, master punner (not everyone enjoys them, though. :P). <br>

I've tried my hand at a bunch of different things: networks, cross-stitch and learning the violin.<br>
I guess this is where I attempt to write about cool stuff. <br>

Welcome to my home on the internet, hope you like it here!
