It's been ages since I last wrote something for the fun of it. I've written essays, poetry and maybe a couple of stories. Granted, none of it was good, but the point is that I used to write. And somewhere between 8th grade and now, I lost that habit. I'd like to find the creative part of myself again, and maybe that's what brought this blog (or attempt at one) into existence. 

What am I going to write about? I'm really not sure yet. Maybe general thoughts like this, maybe about new tools or tech that I discover. I figure I might learn things better if I decide to jot down interesting findings on the way. 

Here's hoping that I update this space often!
